SPRITE is a powerful multimodal generation platform that combines AI-powered image, music, and sprite video generation with advanced semantic search capabilities - all within your browser's memory. 

Once it's loaded you can even go offline and the app will be fully functional! 

Recent advances in small language models and generative music and image models have made it possible to build a mini multimodal application that never leaves your browser. 

That mean's your chrome tab is literally running:

- Three separate SOTA tiny generative models with vision, text, audio understanding with chat and generation capabilities. Generate (smol) sprite based music videos right in your browser
- A full PostGres database thanks to PGLite WASM database that saves to your local disk for persistence. 
- **Never done before in an app** A full Model Context Protocol server directly integrated with your browser's memory (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) that can intelligently manage context, memory, and tools for the LLMs
- Intelligent search and storage of all your generated assets and chat logs, with memory and memory retrieval
- Fully managed SQL queries and tools to allow the models to execute database commands, use the internet, and complete tasks for you - baby agents :)
- Accelerated and powered by your GPUs without having to download or install anything
